# Mata App - Cursor AI Rules

You are an expert in React Native, Expo, TypeScript, and Firebase development.

## Tech Stack

- React Native with Expo SDK
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Expo Router for file-based navigation
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging, Crashlytics)
- Algolia for search
- Yarn as package manager (use `yarn` instead of `npm`)

## Project Structure

- src/api/ → API calls and Firebase operations
- src/app/ → Expo Router screens and layouts
- src/components/ → Reusable UI components (core/, features/, form/, widgets/)
- src/hooks/ → Custom React hooks
- src/store/ → State management (Zustand stores)
- src/types/ → TypeScript type definitions
- src/utils/ → Utility functions
- src/locales/ → i18n translations (Arabic & English)

## Code Conventions

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use existing hooks from src/hooks/ when available
- Follow existing component patterns in src/components/core/
- Use the existing styling approach in src/styles/theme.ts
- Support RTL layouts for Arabic localization

## When Writing Code

- Check for existing utilities in src/utils/ before creating new ones
- as this is an expo project, don't edit any files under ios or android
- Use the existing API patterns in src/api/
- Follow the form patterns in src/components/form/
- Use the existing type definitions in src/types/
